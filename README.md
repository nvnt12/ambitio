# Hero Section - Frontend Developer Intern Assignment

## 📌 Overview
This project is a hero section implementation based on the provided Figma design. The goal was to accurately translate the design into code while ensuring responsiveness and adding smooth animations/interactions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Next.js / React.js** for development
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **TypeScript** for type safety and prop validation
- **Framer Motion** for animations

## ✨ Approach
1. **Component-Based Structure:**
   - Divided the page into logical sections.
   - Created separate components for reusable elements to maintain clean and modular code.

2. **Development Process:**
   - Built the desktop version first for accurate design implementation.
   - Adjusted responsiveness for different screen sizes (tablet & mobile).

3. **Best Practices:**
   - Used **mapping** for repeating elements instead of hardcoding.
   - Avoided redundant code by following **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles.
   - Ensured **TypeScript validation** on props for better maintainability.

4. **Animations & Interactions:**
   - Used **Framer Motion** to add smooth animations to the **stats section**, making the numbers animate dynamically.

## 📱 Responsiveness
The hero section is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on all devices.
